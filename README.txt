Kmeans Technical Challenge for Woven Planet

1. L1_K3_Data100 (Data based on the L1 norm):
Cluster: 3
Number of data: 100
|
|--> kmeans.txt 		- Contains all the summary data of both Training and Testing (Eg. centroid errors, accuracy etc)
|
|--> output_iris_train.csv 	- A copy of the source dataset ("iris_train.csv") but with an additional classification (cluster) column appended at the 5th column
|
|--> output_iris_test.csv 	- A copy of the source dataset ("iris_test.csv") but with an additional classification (cluster) column appended at the 5th column
|
|--> Train_Figure_1.png		- Figure with data points and clusters plotted based on the "iris_train.csv" dataset
|
|--> Test_Figure_2.png		- Figure with data points and clusters plotted based on the "iris_test.csv" dataset



2. L2_K3_Data100 (Data based on the L2 norm):
Cluster: 3
Number of data: 100
|
|--> kmeans.txt 		- Contains all the summary data of both Training and Testing (Eg. centroid errors, accuracy etc)
|
|--> output_iris_train.csv 	- A copy of the source dataset ("iris_train.csv") but with an additional classification (cluster) column appended at the 5th column

|
|--> Test_Figure_2.png		- Figure with data points and clusters plotted based on the "iris_test.csv" dataset



3. environment.yml		- conda environment file that can be used to create the environment in order to easily install the necessary packages and run the program


4. iris_train.csv		- original train dataset


5. iris_test.csv		- original test dataset


6. kmeans.py			- python source code developed under conda Python 3


7. 
dist
|
|--> kmeans
      |
      |--> kmeans.exe		- Application file packaged to run without conda or python 
                                - Tested on Windows 10


8. 
__pycache__			- dll and lib Files created after packaging kmeans.py
build
kmeans.spec


9. README.txt			- This file
